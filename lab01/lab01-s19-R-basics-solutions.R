# monthly bills of Leia (a stats undergrad student): 
#  cell phone $80, transportation $20, groceries $527, gym $10, 
# rent $1500, other $83.

# total expenses
80 + 20 + 527 + 10 + 1500 + 83

# assignment operator "arrow"
phone <- 80


# Make more assignments to create variables `transportation`, `groceries`, `gym`, 
# `rent`, and `other` with their corresponding amounts:
transportation <- 20
groceries <- 527
gym <- 10
rent <- 1500
other <- 83

# create a `total` object with the sum of the expenses:
total <- phone + transportation + groceries + gym + rent + other
total

# semester expenses (assume the semester involves five months)
total * 5

# year expenses (10 months)
total * 10

# your vector expenses (with named elements)
